# TCP Bulbs - more reliable

This repo is forked from the SmartThings code for TCP-Bulbs (Connect).  It has been updated to provide more stability with the SmartThings integration.  So far, it is much more stable than the official app:

To use:

0.  Remove the old app and lights from your SmartThings installation.
1.  Open your SmartThings IDE
2.  Create a new SmartThings App, paste the `tcp-bulbs-connect.groovy` code contents into the window.
3.  Save and "publish" for 'me'.  
4.  Go to the "My device handlers" tab and create a new device handler.
5.  Paste the code from `tcp-bulb.groovy` in there and "publish" for 'me'
6.  Install this app:   Go to "marketplace" -> "SmartApps" -> "My Apps" -> and select "TCP Bulbs - more reliable"
7.  Go on as before.  Submit any issues you find here as an 'issue'.  

## Credit
Most credit goes to Todd Wackford who made the original app.  I only updated it to fix some issues I was having.  I hope it's useful to others.
